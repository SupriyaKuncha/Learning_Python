Subject: Request for Project Allocation – Open to Any Technical Opportunity

Dear [HR's Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to express my eagerness to be mapped to a project at the earliest. I have completed my training and have been proactively building my skills, as reflected in my resume. My technical background includes hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, ReactJS, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, and UI/UX design using Figma. I’ve also worked on full-stack projects, including web applications and AI-based models, which demonstrate both my frontend and backend development capabilities.

While I have listed certain skills in my resume, I want to assure you that I am completely open to taking up any technical project, even if it requires learning new tools or technologies. I am a quick learner and committed to adding value to whichever team I join.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to have a brief call with you to discuss my profile and explore any potential openings where I can contribute effectively.

Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to your guidance and help in getting mapped to a suitable project.

Warm regards,
K. Yella Venkata Supriya
